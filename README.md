# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was the create a study guide for students in the coding bootcamp. I built this project to not only help me but other students in the class. It solved the problem of not having a study guide, as well as giving students one place to go to study what they've learned. I learned many things creating this page, such as how to work with different languages and how to build a page. I learned HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
